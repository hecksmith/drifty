# Drifty

Create an emulated controller (XBox 360), that has fixed amount of drift applied.

Intended for use to test aim-assist in FPS/shooter games, e.g. COD.

No further scope planned or intended.

NOTE: Does NOT combine with your own inputs. (The controller it creates is separate to any you may have plugged in).

## Contributing

The project is intentionally simple and **done**, so it is **closed to contribution**. But fork away :)
